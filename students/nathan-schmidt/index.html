    <p id="about-me" class="content">My name is Nathan Schmidt. I was born and raised in Vancouver. I have been doing part time studies at BCIT 
        after choosing to leave university. I was lucky enough to travel with my family 
        while I was younger. My last trip in the Spring of 2015, was to Machu Pichu in Peru.</p>
