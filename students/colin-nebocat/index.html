          <h4>Life Before RED Academy</h4>
          <p>I was living in Toronto working as a bartender at night and searching for a marketing job in the automotive industry. I also studied <a href="http://hackeryou.com/part-time-courses/seo/" target="_blank">SEO at HackerYou</a> and was offered a few SEO positions but left them soon after. I thought Toronto would be a great place to start a career in marketing after graduating; however, after a bunch of low-quality jobs, I decided to come back to Vancouver because I really missed the ocean, mountains, and my family.</p>

          <h4>Favourite Travel Experience</h4>
          <p>In 2009, I went to Australia and did a working holiday. I lived and worked at a hostel in Cairns where I got a part-time job driving the hostel's shuttle bus. I learned to drive a right-hand-drive vehicle with a manual transmission, which was challenging but rewarding. Everyday I would make multiple trips to downtown and back picking up or dropping off guests of the hostel. It was a fun job for a few months and allowed me to experience real life in a small Australian town.</p>

          <h4>An Interesting Fact About Myself</h4>
          <p>I'm a Korean adoptee who grew up in Gibsons and Vancouver with German Canadian parents.</p>

          <h4>Secret Talent</h4>
          <p>My secret talent would have to be making a killer Bloody Caesar. It seems I was taught well because whenever I make someone a Bloody Caesar, they always come back for a second. I don't really like to drink them myself, but I guess I'm good at making them!</p>

          <p>Start my own digital marketing agency or tech company!
