 <h3>Manifesto</h3>
 <p>Like so many other vampiric industries, Logistics seemed like a passable way to bankroll 
     a backpacking trip through Europe in my early 20's. It did that, and I enjoyed it so 
     much it made the decision to work towards a trip through Southeast Asia almost a 
     no-brainer. Some time after this trip I seem to have fallen asleep and awoken over a decade 
     later stress-beaten, sunken of eye and weary of soul. Managing the noble works of the 
     transportation world have taken their toll on me, drained me of my being, and discarded 
     me like a spent Keurig cup. I was forced to carve out a living as an underground
     bareknuckle boxer until I'd saved enough for a web development course.</p>

         <h3>...continued</h3>
<p>Or rather, I was lucky enough that a real-estate investment afforded me the opportunity to 
    make a positive change in my life and work towards something I can find happiness in for a 
    change! I've always had an entrepreneurial spirit, however my area of expertise is 
    not conducive to startup businesses for non-millionaires. I hope that web development 
    will eventually allow me to pursue my dream of self-employment as well as provide a 
    creative outlet that is sadly lacking when you're managing trucks and trailers.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>A large part of my career in logistics involved data management using Excel.
    I came to find that I really enjoyed writing macros and meticulously de-bugging
    the vB code. This is what sealed the deal on my decision to enroll at REDacademy.
    It's a wonderful thing when people realize that they could actually be doing 
    something they WANT to do rather than something they've convinced themselves 
    they HAVE to do.</p>
