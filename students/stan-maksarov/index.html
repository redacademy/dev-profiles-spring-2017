                <h2>What I was doing before RED</h2>
                <p><span class="bold">Hometown:</span> Ulan-Ude, Russia</p>
                <p>Before RED I was a Graphic Designer in a publishing house. I created newspapers and magazines layouts, and other graphic collateral.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>An interesting fact about me</h2>
                <p>I am from far and cold Siberia, from the city of Ulan-Ude. It is located close to the great lake Baikal (background picture of this page).</p>
                <br>
                <h2>My best travel experience</h2>
                <p>Back in November of 2013 my wife and I visited Barcelona. I would never expect to fall in love with this city. Our first choice in Spain was Madrid to be honest, but my mom suggested to go to the capital of Catalonia. So we took her advice and never regret it. Beautiful Barcelona is located between sea and mountains, just like Vancouver, except weather is way nicer :)</p>
                <br>
                <h2>My secret talent</h2>
                <p>Though I haven't played soccer (or football, like we call it in Europe) in a while, I used to be a decent player. So, I tend to believe I am still good at it.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>My goals after graduation</h2>
                <p>I believe I can achieve the level of satisfaction of life in landing a good job in either Web Development or Web Design. I have no illusions though. It is going to be a rocky road for sure.</p>
