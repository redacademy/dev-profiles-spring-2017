      <h2>Before RED</h2>
      <p>I was moving on up with the wonderful people of GUNN, a vertical transportation (aka elevators &amp; escalators) consulting firm. My days were spent seeking out new clients/projects and managing our marketing/communications. Outside of this, I could be found hiking, dancing or answering the phones for a local rape crisis line.</p>

      <h2>Fun Facts!</h2>
      <p>Some of my favourite pastimes are camping and singing while playing the ukelele. When inspired, I like to write my own fun and silly songs about cats and my adventures. </br></br>I've recently started working on a podcast with my 2 cousins, Jennifer &amp; Justine, called JJ Chats. The format is simple: we sit down with guests, wine glasses in hand, and let our discussions take it's natural course. It's currently my favourite side project. Stay tuned for it's release ;)</p>

      <h2>Best Travel Experience</h2>
      <p>To mark the start of something new, I decided to go back to my roots and discover more about the country where my parents were born. This past December, I left for Vietnam to spend 5.5 weeks eating and exploring...and eating some more. (Vietnamese food is INCREDIBLE, by the way!).</br></br>It was a trip with a little bit of everything - a wedding, lots of family (and some drama), adventure, delicious food, ocean &amp; beaches, and so much history. I met many relatives for the first time, and learned more about my parents, grandparents and Vietnam to take home with me. I left feeling grateful to have been born and raised in Canada, but glad to be able to (re)connect with my heritage. My life goals are to improve my Vietnamese and visit more often! &hearts; </br></br>Side note: The cover photo is of Nha Trang, the city where my grandparents and many uncles, aunts and cousins still live.</p>

      <h2>Secret Talent</h2>
      <p>Sewing my own Halloween costumes. It started off when I ambitiously agreed to sew all 5 sailor scout outfits (with some help) for myself and a group of friends, and led to more creative costumes as time went on. Iâ€™ve transformed into the Hamburglar, Wonder Woman, a dragon, the Lorax, and most recently Princess Mononoke!</p>

      <h2>After RED Goals</h2>
      <p>My first goals are to find a solid team to work with and a supportive environment to grow in. I plan to learn and absorb as much as I can as a new Developer. Eventually, I hope to be building useful applications that will make our lives easier, and allow us more time to do the things we love and care about &hearts; </p>
