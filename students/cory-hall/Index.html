  <h2> Why I'm Here
      </h2>
<p>
    As i mentioned before, I have been doing concrete full time for 13 years in my father's company,
    a job i stuck with out of convenience and because it helped my family. 
    However, the longer I do it, the less I see myself doing it for the rest of my life. 
    It wasnt until a few years ago when I built the company website
     (<a href="http://www.coastalconcrete.ca">www.coastalconcrete.ca</a>) using wordpress that web development
    seemed like a viable future for me, however by this time, i had an impending wedding to pay for, 3 weeks after which
    we were pregnant, so that dream had to get shelved for a while til things slowed down, and here we are.

<h3>Random Things About Me
</h3>
<p>

<ul>
   <li>My son is named Jacob Richard Hall, but we usually call him by a meriad of nicknames including, but not limited to: "Jakie", "Jake and Bake", "Stinkerbutt" or simply "The Stink".</li>
   <li>I met my wife, Katie, on plenty of fish 9 years ago, and we've been inseperable ever since. Eveyone always jokes that online dating never works. Worked for me.</li>
   <li>My dogs name is Lucy, but we always call her puggle which is her breed, but also just fun to say.</li>
   <li>I have had the question "can I write my name in the concrete?" asked on average once per hour, for 13 years, and every one of them thought they were being creative.</li>
   <li>I can keep a keg cold in the forest for 4 days without electricity.</li>
   <li>The best trip I ever went on, had to be my wedding in the Mayan Riviera, the group was mostly friends, and not enough family came to have major drama.</li>
