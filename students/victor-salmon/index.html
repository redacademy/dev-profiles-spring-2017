                <h2>Career Interests</h2>
                  <h3>Coding and Me</h3>
                  <p>Despite writing my first batch file when I was 8 years old, I never pursued a career in programming. After teaching myself object oriented programming and databases using Visual Basic 6, I decided to pursue genetic engineering to code biologically. I founded a non profit Project Free Education which is no longer running and partnered with a local university to code a prototype in 2009.</p>

                  <h3>Why RED?</h3>
                  <p>After my degree (and since medical research doesn't pay), I bounced around for a while but decided to try to pursue a career in tech, perhaps a Bioinformatics Project Management; but anywhere in the industry is fine for now. (I also have no idea how to get into Bioinformatics Project Management as the masters programs are slow, academic, and competitive.) </p>
                  
                  <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                  <p>I play guitar, sing, tinker with Arduino microcontrollers, am interested in virtual reality, blog, and actively pursue personal growth.</p>

                <h2>Personal Flair</h2>
                    <h3>Me: A Collection of Communities</h3>
                        <p>I've always been fascinated by culture and how it impacts found family and pair bonding. This has led me to volunteer, explore, and sometimes teach in various different communities. I'm originally from Ladner and love hand-feeding birds at Reifel Bird Sanctuary.<br />
                        <br />
                        I'm uniquely qualified for most Peoples Teams being familiar with many alternative lifestyles. 
                        
                        I also have lots of experience with training. Having been in several network marketing companies, I've constantly been doing personal development and team training. I've also facilitated consent workshops with the Vancouver Consent Crew and taught consensual power dynamics for MetroVancouver Kink. I've also volunteered as a Big Brothers mentor for the last seven years or so and continue to do so.  I identify as queer and as a person of colour, giving me lived experience and a unique perspective.
