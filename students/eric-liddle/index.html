  <h1>What's the story?</h1>
  <p>To start with my name is Eric.  Most recently I am coming from working at TELUS where I was part of the home services team.<br>My time there saw me in a wide variety of roles from team manager, business analyst, training, and more.<br>

  <h1>Why RED?</h1>
  <p>After 6 years with TELUS I decided it was time for a change.  Technology has always been something that has piqued my interest from a young age.<br>With the way the tech industry is headed
  it seems like the right time to get on board.  After having some extenuous exploring I decided to pull the trigger.<br> 
  It was the culture, and the personality of the people that made the decision to join RED so easy, and I can't tell you how excited I am to be here!</p>
